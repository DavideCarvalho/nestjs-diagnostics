 * - `traceId` is taken from `opts.traceId` if given, else auto-filled from the
 *   registered context accessor (if resolvable), else left undefined.
 * - The envelope is built and published ONLY when the channel `hasSubscribers`,
 *   so emitting is effectively free when nothing is listening.
 * - When `opts.sample` is given, it is consulted AFTER the `hasSubscribers` gate
 *   and BEFORE the envelope is built: a falsy result sheds this event without
 *   allocating anything. Default (no `sample`) always publishes when subscribed.
 * - The envelope carries the current {@link SCHEMA_VERSION} as `v`.
 * - Never throws: emitting observability must not break the caller.
 *
 * ```ts
 * emit('billing', 'invoice-paid', { invoiceId: 'inv_123', amount: 4200 });
 * // Shed 90% of a hot event:
 * emit('authz', 'decision', payload, { sample: () => Math.random() < 0.1 });
 * ```
 *
 * When `(lib, event)` is declared in the typed
 * {@link import('./types.js').ChannelRegistry ChannelRegistry}, `payload` is
 * checked against the declared type at compile time; every other pair keeps the
 * untyped `unknown` payload. The runtime behavior is identical either way.
