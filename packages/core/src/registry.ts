 * to a channel by its exact name. A generic observer (the Telescope watcher) that
 * wants to record *all* diagnostics therefore needs to (a) subscribe to every
 * channel that exists now and (b) be told when a new one appears. This registry
 * provides both: {@link registeredChannels} for the current set and
 * {@link onChannelRegistered} for future additions.

/**
 * The registry state, backed by a `Symbol.for` key on `globalThis`. Even when
 * more than one physical copy of this package is loaded (divergent version ranges
 * that pnpm cannot dedupe into a single instance), every copy resolves the SAME
 * `channels`/`listeners`. The channel objects themselves are already process-global
 * via `node:diagnostics_channel`; this makes their discovery registry equally
 * global, so a generic observer always sees every emitted channel regardless of
 * which copy registered it. Uses the same `Symbol.for` global-registry technique
 * the `@dudousxd/nestjs-*` family uses for cross-copy-stable identifiers (e.g. the
 * `CONTEXT_ACCESSOR` token).
